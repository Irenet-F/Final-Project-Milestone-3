This is my final draft, and I feel pretty good about it. I had a tough time with the code and figuring out some nuances. I continued to run into issues with making sure that everything in the codes lined up and was correct. It was very frustrating at first, especially with trying to follow the instructions on the Plotly site. There were a few times that I had to get up, walk away, and come back to the code because it became frustrating.

Although the charts are not super elegant, I am proud of them because they are my work and research. There is a certain level of satisfaction that I turned something so complicated into charts that look so simple. I know that my te,am at wo,rk is proud of what I'm doing, and I can't wait to get to a level that is of professional quality. This has been a great experience. I just need to add in my markdowns to explain my work and put together a brief PP. I'm so happy to be finished.
